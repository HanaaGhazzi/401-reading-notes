## Binary Search Tree Data Structure

_Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:_

- The **left** subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.

- The **right** subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

- There must be no duplicate nodes.

- Insertion, deletion, searching of an element is faster in **BINARY SEARCH TREE** than BINARY TREE due to the ordered characteristics

## BINARY TREE
- A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.
- is a non linear data structure where each node can have almost two child nodes.
