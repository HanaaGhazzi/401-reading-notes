# Component Based UI


### React

- React is a User Interface (UI) library and a tool for building UI components.
- React elements are plain objects.
- Single page application
- Created by facebook

- React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.


### Virtual Dom: 
- React build a new virtual dom sub-tree
- compare it with the old one
-update only the chanced and show it in  real dom 
### JSX
- syntax extension to JavaScript.
- We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like.
- JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
- JSX produces React “elements”.

### Rendering an Element into the DOM
- “root” DOM node; everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.
- To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render()

### Sass
- Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS. We take this compatibility seriously, so that you can seamlessly use any available CSS libraries
- Sass boasts more features and abilities than any other CSS extension language out there. The Sass Core Team has worked endlessly to not only keep up, but stay ahead.
- There are an endless number of frameworks built with Sass. Compass, Bourbon

### Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks:

- React

### What’s the difference between a framework and a library?

The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control". When you call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you.

Both of them defined API, which is used for programmers to use. To put those together, we can think of a library as a certain function of an application, a framework as the skeleton of the application, and an API is connector to put those together. A typical development process normally starts with a framework, and fill out functions defined in libraries through API.
